# HBCU-Hackathon: Canceling Cancer with HPC

HCSC411 Data Science I
The Data Science I course introduces students to some of the most popular statistical methods in data science and machine learning for various tasks, such as classification and regression. The course utilizes a coding/programming language help to identify, analyze, and efficiently organize structured and unstructured data. These languages thus constitute an integral part of the syllabus of Data Science. Modules include a series of hands-on labs which will give students practical skills with applicability to real-world data. At the end of the course, the student completes and presents an analytical summary of an applied learning project using the skills learned throughout the course.

Target Unit to apply Science Gateway / HPC principles:
•	Tree-Based Models 
•	HPC Foundations
•	Using Jupyter notebooks in RStudio Connect

Documentation on how to apply the resources: See the Github for documentation 
•	rfbook.pdf
•	hpc explained.pdf
•	L1_intro Basics of Supercomputing.pdf 
•	Foundational Skills: https://github.com/olcf/hands-on-with-summit 
•	Jupyter notebooks in RStudio Connect, https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/user/jupyter-notebook/

Use Cases:
Supercomputers can help us better understand:
•	the complexity of cancer development, 
•	track down human cancer mutations,
•	identify novel and effective treatments, and 
•	help elucidate patterns in vast and complex data sets that advance our understanding of cancer.

Needed resources:
